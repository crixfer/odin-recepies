# odin-recipes
Odin prpject #1 Recepies

For this project I had to go to Github and creat a new repository, after creating it, I downloaded it
to the repos folder using the SSH key created automatically in github. To do that, I had to use the following
commands in terminal: git clone and the SSH key, in this case: git@github.com:crixfer/odin-recepies.git

With that command, I was able to connect the repository to the local folder. Now, I opened the folder in VS and 
will start to work accordingly.
