# odin-recipes
Odin project #1 Recipes

For this project I had to go to Github and creat a new repository, after creating it, I downloaded it
to the repos folder using the SSH key created automatically in github. To do that, I had to use the following
commands in terminal: git clone and the SSH key, in this case: git@github.com:crixfer/odin-recepies.git

With that command, I was able to connect the repository to the local folder. Now, I opened the folder in VS and 
will start to work accordingly.

Proceeding with the recipes...

After following the step by step guide, I learned how to properly add files, changes made to them, commit and push and pull in git after editing my project.

I used all the necessary steps to add titles, images, link pages and all to make a simple menu page.

Lets continue then.

I had some issues going on due to a change that I made to the index.html. I changed it to Menu thinking that it 
would be better so have it that way, which was a terrible mistake. Thanks to a person named vimukthi I could fix it. After pulling and pushing it back, everything is back to normal now. Awesome!!!
